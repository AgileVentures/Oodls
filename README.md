------------
####As a charity, I want to be able to:
* sign up for the site, so that I'm visible to contributors and receive contributions
* add my contribution requirements, so that I don't receive unwanted contributions
* include my logo and description, so people will recognise me/can form a relationship with me
* edit my listing, so that I can keep my details up to date and ensure that I keep receiving contributions
* remove myself from the site, so that I can stop receiving contributions if I no longer need them
* email previous contributors, so that I can raise emergency contributions
* place an alert/banner on the site, so that I can raise emergency contributions
* reward contributors, so that I can encourage future contributions
* post information about the contributions I've received, so that I can inform people about what we need - and whether there is a shortfall (and what we're lacking) - and enthuse about previous contributions to encourage further contributions and motivate contributors
