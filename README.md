oodls v2.0
==========
This are the preliminary docs for the Oodls project.
This is a reboot of a demo version: [github](https://github.com/Callisto13/Oodls) | [site](http://www.oodls.io/)



Stage 1: MVP
------------
First priorites:
* an about page to inform people and tell them what the site's about
* email signup - probably MailChimp list

####As a charity, I want to be able to:
* sign up for the site, so that I can receive food donations: organisation name, email, password
* create listings, so that conrtributors can find me and give me food

####As a contributor, I want to be able to:
* find out more about the cause, so that I can decide whether or not to contribute
* browse charity listings, so that I can find a charity to contribute food to

Stage 2: Scooter
----------------
####As a charity, I want to be able to:
* edit my listing, so that I can keep my details up to date and ensure that I keep receiving contributions
* include my address, food requirements, opening hours, and main contact in my listings, so that people know when to donate, what to donate and who to contact in the event of queries
* contact the site administrator with any queries, so that I'm completely clear about the site and how to use it, and can report any problems

####As a contributor, I want to be able to:
* view charities on a map, so that I can easily assess which one is easiest to get to


Futher User stories
-------------------
####As a charity, I want to be able to:
* add my contribution requirements, so that I don't receive unwanted contributions
* include my logo and description, so people will recognise me/can form a relationship with me
* remove myself from the site, so that I can stop receiving contributions if I no longer need them
* email previous contributors, so that I can raise emergency contributions
* place an alert/banner on the site, so that I can raise emergency contributions - central heating boost button
* reward contributors, so that I can encourage future contributions
* post information about the contributions I've received, so that I can inform people about what we need - and whether there is a shortfall (and what we're lacking) - and enthuse about previous contributions to encourage further contributions and motivate contributors
* quickly and easily update on a daily basis, what I require so that contributors can see what I need

####As a contributor, I want to be able to:
* see a list of charities, so that I can make a contribution
* sort the list of charities based on their proximity to me, so that I can find the nearest one that will accept my contribution
* get directions to any given charity, so that I can get there easily, without having to manually look the charity up on Google Maps
* share my contributions on Twitter and Facebook, so that I can get my friends and family involved
* flag up a charity to site administrators, so that dodgy charity listings can be removed
* sign up to receive alerts from charities nearby when they are short on food, so that I can help out when they are in need of food

####As a site administrator, I want to be able to:
* remove dodgy charity listings from the site, so that the site remains trust-worthy and listings are reliable
* block user accounts from the site, so that people can't keep posting dodgy listings
* ensure that users signing up to the site are real people, so that oodls doesn't end up riddled with spam bots
* publicise the site and it's cause, to get more people using it and drive up contributions
* blog about the site activity,as a way to publicise the site, and get contributors and charities motivated
* send out alerts to site users/charities, to inform them about changes to the site and keep them engaged
